# Simple-File-Management-System
This is a simple simulator of Linux operating system.
Every logged in user is able to create a file system. 
They can create a root folder, and they are able to create subfolders inside the folders.
The overall structure seems like a general tree. 
The root folder is the root, and branches and leaves are child folders and files inside the parent folder.
Users can use commands same as those of Linux commands to create and delete folders or files.
For the folders and files they create, they are able to determine which can be read or written. 
Furthermore, they are able to determine specifically which users are able to or do changes to folders and files, by assigning Access to users in the users list.
